#  AI-Based Expense Tracker â€“ Backend

This is the backend for the **AI-based Expense Tracker** web application.  
It supports expense recording, OCR-based bill scanning, AI-driven expense categorization, and chatbot interaction.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js + Express** â€“ Core backend server (`server.js`)
- **Python + Flask** â€“ 
  - OCR Service (`ocr_server.py`)
  - AI Categorization (`api.py`)
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ Database (hosted on Render)
- **Dialogflow** â€“ Optional chatbot interface for natural language expense handling

## Dialogflow Chatbot Integration

This project supports a smart conversational interface using **Dialogflow**, allowing users to interact with the Expense Tracker via natural language.

### ðŸ”— Supported Intents

| Intent Name             | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Add Expense**         | Add a new expense via chat (e.g., "I spent 200 on food"). |
| **Add Participants**    | Add participants to a group. |
| **Get Balance**         | Get overall balance among all participants. |
| **Get Person Balance**  | Check how much a specific user owes or is owed. |
| **Get Monthly Expenses**| Get total expenses for a given month. |
| **Get Expenses By Date**| View expenses recorded on a specific date. |
| **Get Expenses By Category** | Retrieve expenses under a specific category (e.g., "food", "travel"). |
| **Today Expenses**      | Get all expenses recorded today. |
| **Show Participants**   | Display all current participants in a group. |
| **Default Welcome Intent** | Greet user when the chatbot is started. |
| **Default Fallback Intent**| Handles unrecognized queries gracefully. |

>  These intents are linked to webhook functions already implemented in `server.js`, which route the request to appropriate database or ML-powered services (like `api.py` or `ocr_server.py`).
>  You can create more intents to add more functionalities.
>  Each intent has training phrases defined to capture various ways users might express their intent naturally.


### How It Works

1. User sends a message to the Dialogflow chatbot (via UI or embedded widget).
2. Intent is matched and triggers the corresponding webhook call.
3. Backend (`server.js`) handles the request, interacts with the database or ML APIs as needed.
4. Response is sent back to Dialogflow and shown to the user.

### Want to Use It?

>  Viewers can **create their own Dialogflow agent** and **replicate the intents** listed above using training phrases.
> This modularity allows you to connect the chatbot to your own backend or the existing hosted one.
