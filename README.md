## Deployment (Render)
This project uses Render for hosting multiple services:
1.Node.js
2.OCR Service (Docker)
3.ML API (Docker)

## Dialogflow Chatbot Integration

This project supports a smart conversational interface using **Dialogflow**, allowing users to interact with the Expense Tracker via natural language.

###  Supported Intents

| Intent Name             | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Add Expense**         | Add a new expense via chat (e.g., "I spent 200 on food"). |
| **Add Participants**    | Add participants to a group. |
| **Get Balance**         | Get overall balance among all participants. |
| **Get Person Balance**  | Check how much a specific user owes or is owed. |
| **Get Monthly Expenses**| Get total expenses for a given month. |
| **Get Expenses By Date**| View expenses recorded on a specific date. |
| **Get Expenses By Category** | Retrieve expenses under a specific category (e.g., "food", "travel"). |
| **Today Expenses**      | Get all expenses recorded today. |
| **Show Participants**   | Display all current participants in a group. |
| **Default Welcome Intent** | Greet user when the chatbot is started. |
| **Default Fallback Intent**| Handles unrecognized queries gracefully. |

>  These intents are linked to webhook functions already implemented in `server.js`, which route the request to appropriate database or ML-powered services (like `api.py` or `ocr_server.py`).
>  You can create more intents to add more functionalities.
>  Each intent has training phrases defined to capture various ways users might express their intent naturally.


### Want to Use It?
> You can create your own Dialogflow agent and connect it to this backend or your custom deployment.
>  Viewers can **create their own Dialogflow agent** and **replicate the intents** listed above using training phrases.
> This modularity allows you to connect the chatbot to your own backend or the existing hosted one.
